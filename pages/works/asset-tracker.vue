              I have been using TradingView to track stocks, cryptocurrencies,
              and indices for personal investing. While it offers extensive
              tools and features, I wanted a simpler, personalized dashboard to
              quickly access my favorite assets and customize how I interact
              with charts. This project is designed to meet that need, starting
              with the essential features in the first phase. As I continue
              using it, future updates will add more features based on my
              evolving needs and how I interact with the platform.

          <p class="text-sm">
            I chose to work with Nuxt.js for this project due to my proficiency
            with Vue.js and the need to support multiple pages and server-side
            rendering (SSR) for scalability in the future. Nuxt also simplifies
            routing, making it efficient for managing navigation between pages.
            Initially, I used Chart.js, a library I’m familiar with from my
            workplace. However, I later switched to TradingView's lightweight
            charts because they are more visually appealing and offer a wider
            variety of chart types for customization. For the data, I chose
            Alpha Vantage after researching available options, as it offers an
            ample free-tier limit of 25 API calls per day, making it the most
            convenient choice.

          <h3 class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Problems and thought process</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            At first, I integrated Supabase to fetch data from the API, store it
            in the database, and retrieve it as needed. However, when the API
            limit became a constraint, I decided to remove Supabase and directly
            display the data returned by the API. I designed the dashboard to
            show different types of charts from a single API call, updating the
            data only when necessary. Currently, I couldn’t retrieve index fund
            data, so I postponed implementing a comparison feature between index
            funds and selected stocks. Since this was my first time using the
            library, I started with simple configurations and gradually added
            complexity as I became more familiar with its features.

          <p class="text-sm">
            The main lesson I learned is how to effectively use lightweight
            charts. Similar to my previous projects, I planned and implemented
            features throughout the development process, which involved many
            trials and errors. It also taught me the importance of adapting to
            limitations, such as API call restrictions, and finding creative
            solutions to overcome them.
