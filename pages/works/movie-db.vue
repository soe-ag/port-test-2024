              This project started from a simple wish, having my own database to
              store and organize my favorite movies and TV series. I had tried
              using IMDb for tracking my watch list and favorites, but I found
              the interface a bit clunky and heavy for my needs. So, I set out
              to create a personalized, lightweight solution. This is just Phase
              1 of the project, and I'll continue adding features based on what
              I find useful, with plans for a Phase 2 release in the future.

          <p class="text-sm">
            I have a solid foundation in Vue, and for this project, I decided to
            work with Nuxt to incorporate server-side rendering (SSR) and take
            advantage of Nuxtâ€™s straightforward routing features. Since I use
            UnoCSS at work, I chose it here as well for a familiar, efficient
            styling experience, aiming to get the job done with my most-used
            tools rather than focusing on the "perfect" stack. I originally went
            with Firebase for the database, but I switched to Supabase because
            it just worked better for what I needed, and the documentation made
            things a lot easier to follow. Firebase felt a bit complicated since
            it needs different setups for client and server, plus specific SDKs
            like Firebase Admin on the server side.

          <h3 class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Problems and thought process</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            I initially started with local storage for saving data since I
            wasnâ€™t familiar with Firebase or Supabase yet. But as the project
            evolved, I wanted access to my data from any device, which local
            storage couldnâ€™t offer.
            <!-- Plus, I wanted to challenge myself with new
            technologies. Switching to Supabase opened up more possibilities,
            like adding authentication, querying, and filteringâ€”making data
            manipulation easier.  -->
            The first hurdle was setting up the environment and dependencies
            without breaking anything in the existing project. After a lot of
            trial and error, I got it running smoothly. Next, I tackled
            Supabaseâ€™s built-in auth, setting up user accounts for secure data
            access. Initially, Iâ€™d written everything as client-side API calls,
            but eventually refactored for server-side rendering where it made
            sense, which streamlined data handling on page load.
            <!-- Along
            the way, I cleaned up my code to make it reusable and followed some
            best practices from my work environment, even though this was a
            personal project. There were plenty of challenges along the way, but
            by diving into the docs, troubleshooting with ChatGPT, and plenty of
            debugging, I wrapped up Phase 1 of my project! -->

          <p class="text-sm">
            Working on this project has been a huge learning experience,
            especially in building something from scratch. Iâ€™ve gained a solid
            understanding of Nuxt, Supabase, and API implementation, along with
            the skills to troubleshoot bugs effectively. In the beginning, I
            focused on getting each feature working, which meant writing simpler
            code to keep things moving. Later, I went back to refactor it for
            reusability and clarity, knowing that would make it easier to expand
            in the future. Since I didnâ€™t start with a defined design or
            component structure, I found myself constantly writing, deleting,
            and editing to improve readability and maintainability. This
            approach worked, but I realized how much easier things would have
            been with a good design and structure from the start. It wouldâ€™ve
            saved time, reduced rework, and probably prevented a few headaches
            along the way ðŸ˜„.
