              This project began with a simple goal: to create a personal
              database for organizing and tracking my favorite movies and TV
              series. While IMDb was a great resource, I found its interface
              overloaded for my specific needs. I wanted something lightweight,
              and tailored to how I like to manage my watch list and favorites.
              This version is just the starting point, and I plan to build on
              it, incorporating additional features as I discover what works
              best for me.

          <p class="text-sm">
            For this project, I chose Nuxt for its server-side rendering (SSR)
            and straightforward routing, leveraging my Vue experience. I used
            UnoCSS for styling, as itâ€™s a tool Iâ€™m already familiar with from
            work. Although I started with Firebase, I switched to Supabase
            because it better suited my needs, offering simpler setup and
            clearer documentation. Firebaseâ€™s setup felt overly complex,
            requiring separate configurations and SDKs for client and server
            environments.

          <h3 class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Problems and thought process</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            I initially used local storage to save data, as I wasn't familiar
            with Firebase or Supabase. However, as the project grew, I realized
            I needed access to my data from multiple devices, which local
            storage couldnâ€™t provide. The first challenge was integrating
            supabase without disrupting the existing project. After some trial
            and error, I got everything running smoothly. Originally, I used
            client-side API calls, but I later refactored the project to
            incorporate server-side rendering, improving data handling when the
            page loaded.
            <!-- Along
            the way, I cleaned up my code to make it reusable and followed some
            best practices from my work environment, even though this was a
            personal project. There were plenty of challenges along the way, but
            by diving into the docs, troubleshooting with ChatGPT, and plenty of
            debugging, I wrapped up Phase 1 of my project! -->

            This project has been a valuable learning experience, especially in
            building from scratch. I've gained a good understanding of Nuxt,
            Supabase, and working with API integration. At first, I focused on
            getting features working quickly with simple code, then went back to
            refactor it for better reusability and clarity. Since I didnâ€™t start
            with a clear design, I ended up iterating a lot to improve
            readability and maintenance. Looking back, having a solid design and
            structure from the start would have saved time and prevented some
            frustration! ðŸ˜„
